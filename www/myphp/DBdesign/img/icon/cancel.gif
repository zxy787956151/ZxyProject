<!--
   - Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
   - "feature" to Internet Explorer.  If the text in
   - an error's message is "too small", specifically
   - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
   - its own error message.  Yes, you can turn that
   - off, but *surprise* it's pretty tricky to find
   - buried as a switch called "smart error
   - messages"  That means, of course, that many of
   - Resin's error messages are censored by default.
   - And, of course, you'll be shocked to learn that
   - IIS always returns error messages that are long
   - enough to make Internet Explorer happy.  The
   - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
   - message with a big comment to push it over the
   - five hundred and twelve byte minimum.  Of course,
   - that's exactly what you're reading right now.
